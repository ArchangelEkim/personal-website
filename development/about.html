          I am a first year student currently studying a Bachelor of Science majoring in Statistics with a sub-major in Information Technology,
          as well as a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies majoring in Japanese. 
          <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/bachelor-science-bachelor-arts-international-studies" title="Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Arts International Studies">Here</a> is the link to the UTS page of this degree.
          I have many interests in various areas of science, computing, photography and food. I consider myself an amateur landscape and nature
          photographer slowly developing my skills. I take part in various sports to stay active such as orienteering and rowing; I personally love watersports such as paddleboarding, kayaking and canoeing.
